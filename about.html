					<h2>Who is he?</h2>
				
					<p>
						Born in Colombia and raised in Puerto Rico, David moved to the U.S. to seek out a better college education. He attended the
						<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ucf.edu/">University of Central Florida</a>, from which he graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. He knew, however, that 
						that would not be enough for him. He knew he wanted to code programs and create websites, but he also wanted to give them 
						elegant designs, because it's not just WHAT you say, it's also HOW you say it. With that in mind, he decided to seek out a
						Graphic/Interactive Design degree from <a target="_blank" href="http://valenciacollege.edu/">Valencia College</a> from where he's currently on his way to becoming a great
						designer.

					<p>
						TL;DR:

						David Hernandez is the programmer/graphic designer that you are looking for. If you have a project, may it be a
						website, mobile app, or logo, in mind and you're and you are looking for a designer that can help you bring it to life 
						then look no further, you have found him.

					<blockquote>
						"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom I can tell you I don't 
						have money, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very short career. 
						Skills that make me a blessing for people like you. If you don't hire me now that'll be the end of it. 
						I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you do, I will not disappoint you, I will work with you and I will make
						you proud."
						<br>
						-David Hernandez [paraphrased from the movie <b>Taken</b> (2013)]
