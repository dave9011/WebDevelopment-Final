Technique #1:

	1. The technique is called: 'Seamless Responsive Photo Grid' (https://css-tricks.com/seamless-responsive-photo-grid/).
	2. I've seen this technique used in a few sites over the past year and I've always wanted to know how to 
		implement it. I plan to use it for my portfolio/projects section and any other page were I want to put 
		a gallery.
	3. This technique uses only CSS.
	4. The idea behind the technique is briefly explained and a short example is also included.
	5. According to the website, it works from: Firefox 3.6+, Opera 11.1+, Safari 4+, Chrome 10+, and IE10+.
	6. I intend to use this technique in my project.
	
Technique #2:

	1. The technique is called: 'Bouncy Animated Loading Animation' (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/bouncy-animated-loading-animation/).
	2. I wanted to find a technique that uses only CSS to show a loading animation so that I don't have to use a GIF. I would use this tehcnique 
		to show the loading animation for the web page and/or any images I include.
	3. This technique uses only CSS.
	4. A snippet of code is included in the resource, as well as link to an example on JSFiddle.
	5. Is it not specified in the website where I got it from, but the snippet uses CSS3 animations which at the moment work in: Chrome, Firefox 5+,
		IE 10+, Opera 12+, and Safari 4+.
	6. I doubt I will use this technique.
	
Technique #3;

	1. The technique is called: 'Random Hex Color' (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/random-hex-color/).
	2. The example used the technique to generate a random background color for the page on reload. I thought this would be a pretty 
		interesting idea to use, whether it be for the background color or some other element(s).
	3. This technique uses JavaScript.
	4. The page itself only contains the line of code that gets the random color. I had to look to use 'Inspect Element' to look at the script 
		code in order to see how it works.
	5. The technique should work on any site that allows JavaScript.
	6. I'm not sure where I would use this technique. If I find a good place for it and it looks good then I'll use it.
